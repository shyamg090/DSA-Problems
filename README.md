## Introduction

The DSA problems included in this repository are organized by different categories such as arrays, linked lists, trees, sorting, searching, and more. Each problem is presented as a separate file with a detailed explanation of the problem statement and a solution implemented in C++.

The main objective of this repository is to provide you with a platform to practice your coding skills by solving a variety of DSA problems. By regularly practicing these problems, you can improve your problem-solving abilities and gain a deeper understanding of various data structures and algorithms.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shyamg090/DSA-Problems.git
   ```

2. Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. If not, install one such as gcc or clang.

3. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory:

   ```bash
   cd DSA-Problems
   ```

## Usage

Each DSA problem is stored in a separate file. To run a specific problem, compile the corresponding C++ file and execute the resulting binary.

For example, let's say you want to run a problem called `array_rotation.cpp`. Open your terminal and enter the following commands:

```bash
g++ array_rotation.cpp -o array_rotation
./array_rotation
```

Replace `array_rotation` with the name of the specific problem you want to run.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to experiment with different solutions and test cases.
